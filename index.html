				<img class="subimage" src="images/one.jpg" alt="Air handling unit">
				<div class="subtext">This is an Air Handling Unit (AHU) which takes air, some from the building and some from outside, and heats or cools the air depending on heating or cooling requests from the occupants.
				</div>
			</div>				

			<div class="image_group">
				<img class="subimage" src="images/two.jpg" alt="Chilled water connections to AHU">
				<div class="subtext">At the AHU services like chilled water, steam, and hot water come into the AHU. These services are what provide the energy which cools, dehumifies, and heats the air which is supplied to the building.
				</div>
			</div>				
			<div class="image_group">
				<img class="subimage" src="images/three.jpg" alt="Building hydronic mains">
				<div class="subtext">Hydronic services are routed through the building in large piping referred to as "mains". These mains are very well insulated to prevent to loss of energy and, in the case of chilled water, water damage from condensation.
				</div>
			</div>				
			<div class="image_group">
				<img class="subimage" src="images/four.jpg" alt="Air cooled chiller">
				<div class="subtext">An air cooled chiller will take heat from the chilled water coming from the AHU and put it into the outside environment. The chilled water will then return to the AHU and gain heat from the building air.

			<div class="quotes">HVAC is the life blood of a modern building. In many areas of the world the interior spaces would be inhospitable without advanced HVAC equipment. I sit in wonder and awe in the presence of air handling units. They are truly remarkable feats of engineering. </div>
